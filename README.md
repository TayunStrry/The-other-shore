Embrace sincerity and anticipation. The bedrock plugin community can gradually imitate java.
To do this, we created a bedrock plan

The Bedrock Project is divided into three parts

Instruction-based matrix interface
For drawing trajectories and boundaries with limited and simple parameters

Based on block tags, completely based on the magic industry implemented by custom blocks
For tasks that attempt to automate the industry by being fully data-driven

Floating solutions based on data-driven entities
Try crafting, more interesting combat skills and character features
