Sincerely look forward to the modding community of the Bedrock Edition, which can gradually follow the Java Edition
The Bedrock Edition Infrastructure Research Project is hereby launched

The Bedrock Project is divided into three areas,

Matrix interface based on vanilla commands
Used to draw trajectories and borders with limited and simple parameters

Based on the block tag, completely based on the realization of the custom block Magic Industry
For tasks that try to achieve industrial automation by being completely data-driven

Floating solutions based on data-driven entities
For trying to make, more interesting combat skills and character functions
